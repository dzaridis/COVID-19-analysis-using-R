# COVID-19-analysis-using-R
In this project a dataset containing daily confirmed cases and deaths globally and in each country individual was used in order to find relations between them.<br/> This was a 15 page report for the "Programming tools & techniques for data analysis" course in PhD program of National Technical university of Athens(NTUA)<br/>
***Project Grade 10/10***
1. The dataset was taken from <br/>
a)https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv \
for confirmed cases <br/> b)https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv
3. An analysis combining two datasets, the aforementioned and a dataset containing population information and other geographical informatics.
4. in this way valuable information extracted about the way each country or even continent responded to the COVID-19 pandemic on 2020.  
- [x] Code available for professor's tasks in [assignment.Rmd](assignment.Rmd)  
- [ ] Code not available for self-implemented analysis that is extra from the assignment.  
- Below are presented som of the results from the data analysis. For extended description of the results do not hesitate to open [Covid analysis report.pdf](https://github.com/dzaridis/COVID-19-analysis-using-R/blob/main/Covid%20analysis%20report.pdf)
